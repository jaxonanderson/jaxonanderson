Hello, I suppose! I'm not really anyone special, just a normal guy, but I guess I'll explain more about me.



Name: Jaxon Anderson, birth name. Used to go as Asher as a kid, but doesn't mind it being used on him now.

Pronouns: He/hym; he's a little new to new-age terms, but he's very much willing to learn.

Gender: Egogender genderqueer demiboy!

Sexuality: Heteroflexable, he's not too picky in partners, though.

Age: 27, though he doesn't think about it too much, as he is forever a kid at heart.

Height: 5'11'', though he calls himself short.

Immedient Family: Megan/Meg as his mom and Raine/Radford as his dad, with Rachel as his adopted sister.

Favorite songs: Lovers Rock by TV Girl, My Ordinary Life by The Living Tombstone, and Heavy by the Mari√°s.

Nickname Backstory: One day, Jaxon and Rachel were playing in a park as kids. Rachel, being a trickster herself,decided she wanted to make Jaxon think his name was something else, just for shits and giggles. She settled on the name Asher, and followed though. Their parents never really corrected anyone who called him that, because they just thought it was a fun nickname that kids would always make up for each other. It wasn't until Jaxon turned 17 that he realized his name was Jaxon, and he thinks back on the memory somewhat fondly.

Pets: Owns a corgi named Mellow and a squirrel called Hershey.

Appearance: 

Work in progress!
