Hello, I suppose! I'm not really anyone special, just a normal guy, but I guess I'll explain more about me.

Name: Jaxon Anderson, birth name. Used to go as Asher as a kid, but doesn't mind it being used on him now.

Pronouns: He/hym; he's a little new to new-age terms, but he's very much willing to learn.

Gender: Egogender genderqueer demiboy!

Sexuality: Panromantic demisexual, definitely not too picky in partners, though.

Age: 27, though he doesn't think about it too much, as he is forever a kid at heart.

Height: 5'11'', though he calls himself short, much to Kolby's humor.

Occupation: Couples therapist, although he conciders working at Starbucks part-time to be with his Kolby there.

Immedient Family: Megan/Meg as his mom and Raine/Radford as his dad, with Rachel as his adopted sister.

Boyfriend: Kolby! They've been together for three years, but have been friends for five before that.

Favorite songs: Lovers Rock by TV Girl, My Ordinary Life by The Living Tombstone, and Heavy by the Mari√°s, although he likes many more artists.

Nickname Backstory: One day, Jaxon and Rachel were playing in a park as kids. Rachel, being a trickster herself,decided she wanted to make Jaxon think his name was something else, just for shits and giggles. She settled on the name Asher, and followed though. Their parents never really corrected anyone who called him that, because they just thought it was a fun nickname that kids would always make up for each other. It wasn't until Jaxon turned 17 that he realized his name was Jaxon, and he thinks back on the memory somewhat fondly.

Fun fact: Rachel dyed her hair blue instead of leaving it as her regular brown, solely so she could match her older brother! :-]

Sidenote: He has NO trauma. Childhood trauma? Never heard of it. He gets a litttlee bit traumatized later off, but it doesn't affect him abnormally in the slightest.

Pets: Owns a corgi named Mellow and a squirrel called Hershey, also takes care of his boyfriend's parakeet named Snook.

Appearance: Hazel(?) skin with heterochromia, his left eye is blue while his right is brown. Blue hair with purple clips in it, his boyfriend gave it to him as their one year anniversary present. Shortsleeve cyan hoodie with khaki pants and tan boots. Wears purple spiked bracelets (because he thinks it makes him look more alt) and has star earrings (because he thinks it makes him looks softer). He loves accessories and outfits from all kinds of aestetics, so sometimes his wardrobe will do a complete 180 from goth to cutecore in a night. His wallet doesn't appeciate it, though..

Work in progress!
