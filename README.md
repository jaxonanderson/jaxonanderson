Hello, I suppose! I'm not really anyone special, just a normal guy, but I guess I'll explain more about me.

Name: Jaxon Anderson, birth name. Used to go as Asher as a kid, but doesn't mind it being used on him now.
Pronouns: He/hym, he's a little new to new-age terms, but he's very much willing to learn.
Age: 27, though he doesn't think about it too much, as he is forever a kid at heart.
Height: 5'11'', though he calls himself short.

work in progress !!
